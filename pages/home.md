The Portuguese Minor is designed for students who wish to develop strong language and professional skills and a critical awareness of Brazilian, Portuguese, and Luso-African cultures.  Today Brazil is Latin America’s largest and fastest growing economy and optimism for its long-term future is widely shared.  With the recent 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, student demand for Brazilian language and culture courses has seen a sizeable increase.  Whether students’ interest lie in Latin American studies, visual arts, music, literature, digital poetry, international business, or the African diaspora, the Portuguese Minor is globally minded.  We believe undergraduate Spanish students can quickly learn Portuguese and increase their job credentials.  Our minor provides excellent language instruction through a variety of cultural contexts.
